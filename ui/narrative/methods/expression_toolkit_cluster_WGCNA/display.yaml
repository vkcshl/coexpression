    input_expression_matrix:
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the Expression Matrix to use for WGCNA
        long-hint  : |
            Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab.

    minRsq:
        ui-name : |
            Minimum R Square
        short-hint : |
            Minimum threshold for R2 that measures the fitness of gene co-expression network to scale-free topology in WGCNA
        long-hint  : |
            Minimum threshold for R2 that measures the fitness of gene co-expression network to scale-free topology in WGCNA. See pickSoftThreshold() of WGCNA for details 
# picksoftThreshold function need to be added method in WGCNA

    maxpower:
        ui-name : |
            Max Power
        short-hint : |
            Maximum power to decide the soft threshold
        long-hint  : |
            Maximum power to decide the soft threshold. See pickSoftThreshold() of WGCNA for details.

    maxmediank:
        ui-name : |
            Max Median K
        short-hint : |
            Maximum median connections for genes in network
        long-hint  : |
            Maximum median connections for genes in network. See pickSoftThreshold() of WGCNA for details.

    minModuleSize:
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Module Size
        short-hint : |
            Minimum size of modules 
        long-hint  : |
            Minimum size of modules for the output clusters.

    output_cluster_set :
        ui-name : |
            A set of clusters
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for a set of clusters generated by this method
        long-hint  : |
            After the method has finished running, an ClusterSet data object will be added to your data panel. Provide a name for this data object, using only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

    <p>Begin by selecting or importing both the expression dataset to analyze and the genome associated with the expression dataset using the Add Data button. Provide a name for the output set of clusters. Then, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) can be performed.</p>

    <p>For detailed informatoion about WGCNA, see http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/Simulated-00-Background.pdf</p>
    <p>This method allows users to use WGCNA to detect gene clusters from a expression matrix</p>
